They are widely used in many everyday applications, often without users realizing it—for example, algorithms that automatically read zip codes on mail or recommend movies and products based on your preferences. Learning algorithms can optimize tasks such as improving driving performance for fuel efficiency or analyzing medical records to advance healthcare.\\n\\nThese algorithms work by identifying patterns in data and using those patterns to make predictions or decisions. For instance, a learning algorithm might learn the relationship between the size of a house and its price by analyzing many examples. Learning theory helps us understand when and how well these algorithms perform, including how much data is needed to achieve a certain level of accuracy.\\n\\nThere are different types of learning algorithms, including supervised learning, where the algorithm is trained on data with known correct answers (like distinguishing between malignant and benign tumors), and unsupervised learning, where the algorithm finds structure in data without labeled answers.\\n\\nOverall, learning algorithms are powerful tools that, when well understood and applied, can solve complex problems across various domains.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":51}]}]}
