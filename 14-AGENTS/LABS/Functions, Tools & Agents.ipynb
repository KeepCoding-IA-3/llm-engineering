First introduced in the video games Pokémon Red and Blue, it was created by Atsuko Nishida at the request of lead designer Ken Sugimori, with the design finalized by Sugimori.

While Pikachu has been primarily voiced in media by Ikue Ōtani, other actors have also voiced the character including Kate Bristol, Ryan Reynolds, Kaiji Tang, Hidetoshi Nishijima, Tōru Ōkawa, and Koichi Yamadera.\\nClassified as an Electric-type Pokémon, Pikachu is a large yellow mouse with a lightning bolt-shaped tail, and red sacs on its cheek which can generate large amounts of electricity. Originally designed to be the first part of a three-stage evolution line in Red and Blue, Pikachu evolves into Raichu through the use of a \"Thunder Stone\" item, with Raichu intended to be able to evolve into \\'Gorochu\\'. However \\'Gorochu\\' was removed due to cartridge space concerns, and a pre-evolution for Pikachu, Pichu, was later added in the sequel titles Pokémon Gold and Silver.\\nPikachu is widely considered to be the most popular and well-known Pokémon species, largely due to its appearance in the Pokémon anime television series as the companion of series protagonist Ash Ketchum. Pikachu has been well received by critics, with particular praise given for to its cute design, and it has been regarded as an icon of both the Pokémon franchise and Japanese pop culture as a whole.\\n\\nPage: Detective Pikachu (film)\\nSummary: Pokémon Detective Pikachu is a 2019 fantasy film directed by Rob Letterman.

It was first introduced in the video games Pokémon Red and Blue, and later appeared in subsequent sequels and spin-off titles, such as Pokkén Tournament  and Detective Pikachu. In the video games, the player can fight and capture Mewtwo in order to subsequently pit it against other Pokémon. The player can first learn of Mewtwo late in Pokémon Red and Blue by reading research documents left in a ruined laboratory on Cinnabar Island where Mewtwo has escaped. Mewtwo is regarded as one of the series\\' strongest Pokémon, often referred to as \"the world\\'s strongest Pokémon\" in various media, and was the strongest in the original games in terms of base statistic distribution. It is known as the \"Genetic  Pokémon\" and is a Legendary Pokémon, a special group of Pokémon that are very rare and usually very powerful.  Mewtwo has also appeared in various animated adaptations of the franchise.\\nMasachika Ichimura was the first to voice the original Mewtwo character in Japanese, and the creature\\'s younger self is voiced by Fujiko Takimoto in the Sound Picture Box: Mewtwo\\'s Origin CD drama and Showtaro Morikubo in the anime adaptation. In English, Jay Goede voiced Mewtwo in Pokémon: The First Movie (being credited under the pseudonym \"Philip Bartlett\") and the Pokémon Live! musical, while Dan Green provided the voice for The First Movie\\'s direct sequel, Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns. Green reprised the role in the 2019 remake of the first Pokémon movie, Pokémon: Mewtwo Strikes Back Evolution.\\nActress Reiko Takashima voiced a second, unrelated Mewtwo in the Pokémon anime special Mewtwo: Prologue to Awakening and its direct sequel, Pokémon the Movie: Genesect and the Legend Awakened; this second Mewtwo is voiced by actress Miriam Pultro in the English dub. Mewtwo has featured in other game franchises, such as Super Smash Bros. series, in which Ichimura reprised in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Keiji Fujiwara in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. A third Mewtwo also appears in the 2019 live-action animated film Detective Pikachu, voiced simultaneously by Rina Hoshino and Kotaro Watanabe.\\n\\nPage: Pokémon: The First Movie\\nSummary: Pokémon: The First Movie is a 1998 Japanese anime fantasy adventure film directed by Kunihiko Yuyama. The first theatrical release in the Pokémon franchise, the plot takes place during the first season of Pokémon: Indigo League. The film was first released in Japan on July 18, 1998, to positive reviews, with praise directed at the film\\'s emotional impact and exploration of ethical topics such as cloning, genetic modification, and existentialism.\\nThe English-language adaptation was released in North America and other countries on November 10, 1999, by Warner Bros. Pictures. This version was received far less positively, with much criticism pointed at the poorly dubbed voice acting and its inclusion of an anti-violence message contradictory of the series\\' overall concept. Further, retrospective criticism of the dub has been targeted against the removal of most of the ethical topics from the original Japanese version, such as part of Mewtwo\\'s origin story. Despite divided reviews (including Japan and the United States), it was a box office success worldwide, topping the box office charts in its opening weekend and eventually grossing over $172 million at the worldwide box office. It also sold 10 million home video units in the United States, including 4.2 million VHS sales that earned $58.8 million in 2000.\\nOn July 8, 1999, an extended version aired on Japanese television. In addition to an added prologue, the release included new animation and CGI graphics. The film primarily consists of two segments: Origin of Mewtwo, the ten-minute prologue added to the extended version; and Mewtwo Strikes Back, the main 75-minute film feature. Overseas, the prologue can only be seen as a bonus short in DVD versions of Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns. A full CGI remake of the movie, titled Pokémon: Mewtwo Strikes Back – Evolution, was released in 2019.\\n\\nPage: List of Pokémon films\\nSummary: Pokémon is a media franchise created by video game designer Satoshi Tajiri that centers on fictional creatures called Pokémon. As of 2020, there have been twenty-three animated films and one live action film. The first nineteen animated films are based on the anime television series of the same name, while the twentieth, twenty-first, and twenty-third are set in an alternate continuity to the anime. The films are produced by animation studios OLM, Production I.G, Xebec, and Wit Studio, and distributed in Japan by Toho, with various studios distributing the films in North America. They were directed by Kunihiko Yuyama and Tetsuo Yajima and written by Takeshi Shudo, Hideki Sonoda, Atsuhiro Tomioka, Shōji Yonemura, Eiji Umehara, and Aya Takaha. The first Pokémon animated film, Pokémon: The First Movie, was released in Japan in 1998, and in 2019 was remade as Pokémon: Mewtwo Strikes Back – Evolution. A live-action film, Pokémon Detective Pikachu, was produced by American studio Legendary Entertainment, directed by Rob Letterman, and written by Letterman and Nicole Perlman. It was distributed in Japan by Toho and outside of Japan and China by Warner Bros. It was released on May 10, 2019.\\nThe films star Pokémon Trainer Ash Ketchum and his partner Pokémon, Pikachu. Detective Pikachu is based on the 2016 video game Detective Pikachu and stars Ryan Reynolds as the motion capture role of Detective Pikachu, with Justice Smith and Kathryn Newton as the lead human roles.\\nThere are also two animated television specials broadcast on TV Tokyo featuring Ash and his Pikachu and ten animated short films. Warner Bros. licensed the first three animated films in North America and Miramax Films licensed the following four films. From the eighth film onwards, licensing has been handled by The Pokémon Company International themselves, with various distributors handling the releases, such as Viz Media in North America.\\nThe most recent film, Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle, was originally set for release in Japanese theaters on July 10, 2020, but delayed to December 25, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was released on October 8, 2021, in the United States.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":57}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Solo es necesario que enroutemos las respuestas\n"],"metadata":{"id":"HpgwgER6486A"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain.schema.agent import AgentFinish\n","def route(result):\n","    if isinstance(result, AgentFinish):\n","        return result.return_values['output']\n","    else:\n","        tools = {\n","            \"search-wikipedia\": search_wikipedia,\n","            \"get-most-expensive-pokemon-card\": get_most_expensive_pokemon_card,\n","        }\n","        return tools[result.tool].run(result.tool_input)"],"metadata":{"id":"HB_bQXY55AeS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747939155821,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Eric Risco de la Torre","userId":"16820333876295128124"}}},"execution_count":58,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["chain = prompt | model | OpenAIFunctionsAgentOutputParser() | route"],"metadata":{"id":"neepOsJu5Jz6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747939171626,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Eric Risco de la Torre","userId":"16820333876295128124"}}},"execution_count":59,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["result = chain.invoke({\"input\": \"Cual es el Mewto más caro??\"})\n","result"],"metadata":{"id":"rUOrdkuq5LdQ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747939195118,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":3985,"user":{"displayName":"Eric Risco de la Torre","userId":"16820333876295128124"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":36},"outputId":"f9a3fb99-faab-40ec-e14b-4dd475156e75"},"execution_count":62,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Most Expensive Mewtwo Card: Mewtwo ★ - Market Price: $2001.98'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":62}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["result = chain.invoke({\"input\": \"Que me puedes explicar de Leo Messi?\"})\n","result"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":105},"id":"GIo4SDw65O5D","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747939211057,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2345,"user":{"displayName":"Eric Risco de la Torre","userId":"16820333876295128124"}},"outputId":"bf18a77a-8e83-4947-de5b-f0bec731b52c"},"execution_count":63,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Page: Lionel Messi\\nSummary: Lionel Andrés \"Leo\" Messi (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] ; born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi set numerous records for individual accolades won throughout his professional footballing career such as eight Ballon d\\'Or awards and eight times being named the world\\'s best player by FIFA. He is the most decorated player in the history of professional football having won 45 team trophies, including twelve Big Five league titles, four UEFA Champions Leagues, two Copa Américas, and one FIFA World Cup. Messi holds the records for most European Golden Shoes (6), most goals in a calendar year (91), most goals for a single club (672, with Barcelona), most goals (474), hat-tricks (36) and assists (192) in La Liga, most assists (18) and goal contributions (32) in the Copa América, most goal contributions (21) in the World Cup, most international appearances (191) and international goals (112) by a South American male, and the second-most in the latter category outright. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi has scored over 850 senior career goals and has provided over 380 assists for club and country.\\nBorn in Rosario, Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, and made his competitive debut at age 17 in October 2004. He gradually established himself as an integral player for the club, and during his first uninterrupted season at age 22 in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. This resulted in Messi winning the first of four consecutive Ballons d\\'Or, and by the 2011–12 season he would set La Liga and European records for most goals in a season and establish himself as Barcelona\\'s all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, he finished second for the Ballon d\\'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival. However, he regained his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, where he became the all-time top scorer in La Liga, led Barcelona to a historic second treble, and won a fifth Ballon d\\'Or in 2015. He assumed Barcelona\\'s captaincy in 2018 and won a record sixth Ballon d\\'Or in 2019. During his overall tenure at Barcelona, Messi won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues, among others. Financial difficulties at Barcelona led to Messi signing with French club Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021, where he would win the Ligue 1 title during both of his seasons there. He joined Major League Soccer club Inter Miami in July 2023.\\nAn Argentine international, Messi is the national team\\'s all-time leading goalscorer and most-capped player. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler, drew career-long comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. At the youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship and gold medal in the 2008 Summer Olympics. After his senior debut in 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a World Cup in 2006. Assuming captaincy in 2011, he then led Argentina to three consecutive finals in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, the 2015 Copa América and the Copa América Centenario, all of which they would lose. After initially announcing his international retirement in 2016, he returned to help his country narrowly qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, which they would exit early. Messi and the national team finally broke Argentina\\'s 28-year trophy drought by winning the 2021 Copa América, which helped him secure his seventh Ballon d\\'Or that year.

It was first introduced in the video games Pokémon Red and Blue, and later appeared in subsequent sequels and spin-off titles, such as Pokkén Tournament  and Detective Pikachu. In the video games, the player can fight and capture Mewtwo in order to subsequently pit it against other Pokémon. The player can first learn of Mewtwo late in Pokémon Red and Blue by reading research documents left in a ruined laboratory on Cinnabar Island where Mewtwo has escaped. Mewtwo is regarded as one of the series\\' strongest Pokémon, often referred to as \"the world\\'s strongest Pokémon\" in various media, and was the strongest in the original games in terms of base statistic distribution. It is known as the \"Genetic  Pokémon\" and is a Legendary Pokémon, a special group of Pokémon that are very rare and usually very powerful.  Mewtwo has also appeared in various animated adaptations of the franchise.\\nMasachika Ichimura was the first to voice the original Mewtwo character in Japanese, and the creature\\'s younger self is voiced by Fujiko Takimoto in the Sound Picture Box: Mewtwo\\'s Origin CD drama and Showtaro Morikubo in the anime adaptation. In English, Jay Goede voiced Mewtwo in Pokémon: The First Movie (being credited under the pseudonym \"Philip Bartlett\") and the Pokémon Live! musical, while Dan Green provided the voice for The First Movie\\'s direct sequel, Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns. Green reprised the role in the 2019 remake of the first Pokémon movie, Pokémon: Mewtwo Strikes Back Evolution.\\nActress Reiko Takashima voiced a second, unrelated Mewtwo in the Pokémon anime special Mewtwo: Prologue to Awakening and its direct sequel, Pokémon the Movie: Genesect and the Legend Awakened; this second Mewtwo is voiced by actress Miriam Pultro in the English dub. Mewtwo has featured in other game franchises, such as Super Smash Bros. series, in which Ichimura reprised in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Keiji Fujiwara in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. A third Mewtwo also appears in the 2019 live-action animated film Detective Pikachu, voiced simultaneously by Rina Hoshino and Kotaro Watanabe.\\n\\nPage: Pokémon: The First Movie\\nSummary: Pokémon: The First Movie is a 1998 Japanese anime fantasy adventure film directed by Kunihiko Yuyama. The first theatrical release in the Pokémon franchise, the plot takes place during the first season of Pokémon: Indigo League. The film was first released in Japan on July 18, 1998, to positive reviews, with praise directed at the film\\'s emotional impact and exploration of ethical topics such as cloning, genetic modification, and existentialism.\\nThe English-language adaptation was released in North America and other countries on November 10, 1999, by Warner Bros. Pictures. This version was received far less positively, with much criticism pointed at the poorly dubbed voice acting and its inclusion of an anti-violence message contradictory of the series\\' overall concept. Further, retrospective criticism of the dub has been targeted against the removal of most of the ethical topics from the original Japanese version, such as part of Mewtwo\\'s origin story. Despite divided reviews (including Japan and the United States), it was a box office success worldwide, topping the box office charts in its opening weekend and eventually grossing over $172 million at the worldwide box office. It also sold 10 million home video units in the United States, including 4.2 million VHS sales that earned $58.8 million in 2000.\\nOn July 8, 1999, an extended version aired on Japanese television. In addition to an added prologue, the release included new animation and CGI graphics. The film primarily consists of two segments: Origin of Mewtwo, the ten-minute prologue added to the extended version; and Mewtwo Strikes Back, the main 75-minute film feature. Overseas, the prologue can only be seen as a bonus short in DVD versions of Pokémon: Mewtwo Returns. A full CGI remake of the movie, titled Pokémon: Mewtwo Strikes Back – Evolution, was released in 2019.\\n\\nPage: List of Pokémon films\\nSummary: Pokémon is a media franchise created by video game designer Satoshi Tajiri that centers on fictional creatures called Pokémon.
